## Project Architecture

`app` folder contains client react-native app. `setup.js` in the entry point.

### Actions

Contains all redux actions

### Reducers

Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.

### Containers

Containers are full screens and render corresponding sub-components. Provide the data and behavior to other container components. Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources and call redux actions.

### Components

Components are concerned with how things look and have no dependency on redux. Donâ€™t specify how the data is loaded or mutated.

### Navigation

Navigation components reside here.

* `NavigationDrawer.js` - loads in the initial screen and creates menu for to access each screen

### Themes

Styling themes used throughout the app styles.

### Lib

External modules used by the application such as the AdMob library and API class.

### Images

Contains actual images (usually png) used in the application.
